# Feature Flag / Remote Config

Feature Flags using Firebase Remote Config! 
Easily manage and control your app’s features remotely:

✅ Enable/disable features without deploying a new version of your app
✅ Roll out new features to a subset of users gradually
✅ Personalize content dynamically based on user data

Just add your keys in Firebase Remote Config, define them in KAppMaker, and use them however you want!
