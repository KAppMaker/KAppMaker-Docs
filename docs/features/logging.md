# Logging

You can log errors, info, debug messages using `AppLogger`. By default console logs will be turned off for relase builds.

## How To Use

```kotlin

AppLogger.i("Info message")
AppLogger.e("Error message", throwable)
AppLogger.d("Debug message")

```

## Optional Telegram Logger.
Although Firebase Crashlytics was already integrated, solo developers sometimes forget to check it regularly. With optional Telegram Bot logging, youâ€™ll be instantly notified when an error occurs, to fix issues quickly.

How to enable it:

Make sure you update your telegram bot token and chat id in `TelegramLogger` file in `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` fields. By default they are empty, if they have empty values, then TelegramLogger will not be used.  How to get these values:

To get your Telegram Bot Token:

1. Open Telegram app and search for the user "@BotFather".
2. Start a chat and send the command /newbot.
3. Follow the instructions to name your bot and get a unique bot username.
4. BotFather will provide you with the Bot Token (a long string) after creation.

To get your Telegram Chat ID:
1. Add your bot to a Telegram group or chat where you want to receive messages.
2. Alternatively, start a direct chat with your bot.
3. To find the chat ID, send a message to the bot or group.
4. Use the Telegram API or a tool like `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBotToken>/getUpdates` to fetch updates and find the `"chat":{"id": ... }` value corresponding to your chat.


Save your Bot Token and Chat ID in `TelegramLogger` file in `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` fields to enable sending messages.

Now iff you log with error or info message, it will be sent to telegram bot that you created. 
`AppLogger.i("Some info message")`. You will get info in your telegram bot.
